So it has been some time that I have been living in France, and soon I will be leaving from here. I thought it would be nice to document my thoughts about my experience. 

### **One of the most beautiful countries in the world**

Without a doubt, I have to say it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Although I have mostly lived near the Rhone-Alpes region, every region that I visited had a unique aura in itself. Combined with its architectural masterpieces and rich history and well preserved natural parks, no doubt it is the [most visited country in the world.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings)  From the Pristine Alpes in the East to the Magnanimous Atlantic Ocean in the West, from the Bustling city of Paris in the North to the refined elegance of French Riviera in the South, the country is blessed with natural beauty and opulent culture. I could just go on forever talking about the beautiful landscapes of the country but I may not be the best person to describe it. What I intent to do in this blog is to give a sense of how the French society (economy, really) works and what makes them among the few cultures that is really different and worth focusing on. 

### **The Economics of France**

France is a fairly developed country, it may rank 27th in the world interms of GDP per capita, the standard of living for me is on par with any other rich nation. 

Although on the top of it, it seems that the French have figured it out all, good food, great social security, high speed trains, lots of hiking, sex and riots. But the deeper I look into its economy it seems that this may not continue forever, I might be wrong.

#### The French Revolution 

For what it is worth, the French Revolution is what I consider to be one of the most important moment in the modern history of humanity. The effects of this revolution had a long lasting impact on the world for a very long time. Because it not only dethroned the autocracy and put in place democracy, it laid the foundations of modern civil liberty and equality through the infamous “**Declaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen**” (Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen)  document. Due to the Napoleonic wars and Protectionism policies of the 19th century, there was little growth in France compared to Great Britain and it was not until the post World War II that France had really picked up the pace and was able to achieve substantial growth. French revolution did have an impact on the quality of institutions established, I believe that the fate of the country strongly depends on the quality of the institutions. It is these differences in quality of institutions be it political, educational, healthcare, transport that has led to the stark difference between the economies of India or Pakistan, North or South Korea, which share similar culture but have divergent economic trajectories. And it is apt to say, that the French revolution had a significant impact on establishing good quality institutions that has well served its public.

Well, a whole book can be written on the distribution of wealth and the upheaval of the economic system of France following the French Revolution and World Wars, I would let you refer one of the most well-regarded books in this field by the French Economist, Thomas Piketty, [Capital in the Twenty First Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century), for this. 

#### Work Culture

I have been a critic of French work culture saying that they don’t work nearly as hard as their counterparts in other countries ([to some extent it is true for whole Europe](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/26/europe-is-the-free-rider-continent)).     My international friends had a similar opinion, but they used to frame it a bit more differently, constantly bombarding praises about how French people enjoy their life, have so many vacations, have so much leisure time. Although different ways of framing their work culture, we agreed that they enjoyed much superior lifestyle compared to their peers even in developed economies. My initial thoughts were that must be something inherently superior about the system, the culture or the people itself. But the deeper I think, the more I realize that they are just benefiting from the dividends of hard work of the immediate generations after WWII, a shift from industrial economy to a service based economy and of course the colonial wealth. But these dividends are running out and their golden period might be coming to an end, as economic giants of Asia (China, India and Southeast Asian Countries) will increase the competitiveness in almost every sector. This can already been seen by the [stagnation of productivity](https://www.oecd.org/france/oecd-productivity-insights-france.pdf) of the French labor market.  

What this all would essentially mean that in order to stay competitive in their field further they have to churn in more hours than they currently are, as the technological advantages that they possess will soon diminish and increasing the efficiency will become much harder as well as R&D will become more capital intensive endeavor. I think the aim of the pension reform (pension reform is a law brought in by Emmanuel Macron to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64) was the same, to increase the competitiveness of France with respect to rest of the World. And I don’t even think that this will the last reform of the already series of [pro-business reforms](https://investinfrance.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2020-01-13_eng_fiche_reformes_BFInvest.pdf), the [record FDI](https://www.businessfrance.fr/en/discover-France)’s don’t come without any strings attached. 

#### Industries

I would like to call France as “the king of good times”. Why? Because most of its industries like tourism, hospitality, aeroplane manufacturing, spacecraft, automobiles, chemicals (this one is a bit more complex) boom when there is a booming global economy. But if the global economy is not doing well, these industries will also be among the first to be affected. However, one exception comes to my mind, let me give you an hint. You find it as you walk around the beacon of Champ-Élysées within an impeccable window, the symphony that will indulge all your senses, it represents the riddle of opulence, it is the infamous luxury industry of France. The thing with luxury items is that they are relatively well protected from the global economic shocks and inflation, because it targets the wealthiest elites of the world, who are well cushioned against these shocks. And France is rightly positioned as a leader in this market, with 

#### They Protest

Okay, these guys have figured it out about how to perfectly protest. I probably may have come at a wrong time (due to the pension reform) but the efficiency of French in protesting and making the country halt is a common knowledge throughout the World . Don’t get it wrong although the protests might hurt the economy in short horizon a bit and annoy people whose train gets cancelled at last moment :(, but the summer vacations in Saint Tropez won’t enjoy themselves, the Alpes won’t ski themselves, the late nights won’t get drunk by themselves (inspiration [Sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1655255321726832640?lang=en)), it is all possible because of the outrageous stubbornness of the French citizens to stand up for themselves and it is solely because of this reason why France has one of the strongest labor laws. In addition to keeping in-check the Government policies which might be against majority of people’s interest, protests are also a way of showing the presence of a vibrant democracy in the country, which I think in long-term will make the country much more investable and will lead to increase FDI, [which is already happening](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/france/foreign-direct-investment#:~:text=What was France's Foreign Direct,table below for more data.) (again this is **my** thinking). 

#### The French Language

I was ignorant before I came here about the importance of the French Language, I was in utter negligence that most of the Europe could speak English but I was in for a bitter awakening. I think the French people are still in a mindset that French might become the de-facto language in the future, no that isn’t happening mes amies, unless whole of Indian and US education system shifts towards Franco vocabulary. Don’t take me wrong but it can sometimes get really annoying with their Language preferences, I remember once I was subtly kicked out of a meeting because one of the guy was taking eternity to come up with English words. I would classify French people into four categories, first kind are people with good knowledge of English but they wouldn’t talk to you in it(snobs), second are people who are afraid of whether people will judge based on their accent or sentences (initially even I was in this category, when starting out to speak English), third type are people who will talk to you English but only for the sake of you not because they want to (majority)  and fourth are people who are genuinely interested and excited to talk in English (the humblest people).

Anyways, I found it interesting to think what are the large scale impacts of the language on the society, the plus sides are obvious, having your language as the de-facto language can increase the trading opportunities, unlock the economic advantages of ease of doing business of the French companies anywhere in the world, creates thousands of jobs and of-course pride associated with it on the international stage. But this will only happen when it is widely adapted by other countries as well, which I think is only possible if you go back to the good old colonial era. Anyways, trying to forcefully enforce and making the life difficult for foreigners can also make things worse by discouraging the movement of highly skilled workers into the country or decrease in tourism, while I think the latter plays into the hands of French as most of the **western** society thinks that French is a beautiful language and wouldn’t mind saying "bonjour” and “au revoir”, but I wouldn’t expect anything more. All and all a thorough inspection on the affect of language on a society is something I will have to research more about and will probably write another blog on it.

#### Social Mobility

This is an area that I really need to appreciate France, for those who don’t know social mobility refers to the change of socio-economic position of a person relative to his parents or his lifetime. And France has been doing a fairly good job in reducing the income inequality and also socially uplifting the poor compared to other OECD countries. But as the growth of the French economy is stagnating, my main concern is that this again will induce income inequality and hinder the social mobility of the poor people. While economic growth is like a tide which lifts everyone (not necessarily true in all cases), once the tide settles down the rich will have a better position to deal with the stagnation. 

#### Tourism

This is undoubtedly the field that France dominate. This tiny country (for me) attracts more international tourists than their own population and the industry contributes about [10% to their GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_France) and supports millions of jobs. And the country too takes it seriously, which is evident by the presence of ‘Office de Tourisme’ even in smallest of the smallest villages, the well paved roads and high speed railway systems, the abundance of natural parcs (no, it isn’t a spelling mistake), the world class cuisine, the luxury hotels and of course the museums. This may not be enough to impress some Swiss folks :), but for me it was impressive. 

#### Healthcare

The healthcare in France is one of the best (and it is generally true for most of Western European countries), and for good reasons. I ,fortunately, didn’t encounter a situation where I had a need to visit a doctor but once when I was in the immigration department and they asked me to fill a form about my mental health, I didn’t have any issues but I just ticked one of thirty questions which specified whether I had nightmare. They were quick to look into that and gave me a free appointment to a therapist (although I was too afraid to go!). This subtle attention to even mental health, which is often neglected by most countries, astonished me.

#### Paris

I cannot end this blog without addressing the giant that is voracious whirlpool, pulling everything within its reach. Every statistic I look is so skewed just due to this giant of a city, it succumbs the entire nation and tries to summarize it. The railways, the education, the job opportunities, the startup culture, the political seat, the businesses, this city **is the locus**. And one of the main reasons for this that I believe is its historical importance and [clustering effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_theory). Clustering effect is an interesting phenomenon and is almost inevitable and to some extent beneficial but it comes at a significant cost to the quality of living of people, especially for families. It is in the [top 10](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/12/world-most-expensive-cities/) most expensive cities to live in, and believe me I have heard nightmares that people have faced while working from home in the beautiful but small Parisian homes. 

Going from honks of Peugeot to rings of bells, air-cooled from fuels of Arabia to air breezing from the Atlantic, Paris has done great job in making it convenient for people to ride bicycle to get around Paris. The air quality of Paris has improved significantly and a fair bit of it can be attributed to improvement of engine technology, decrease in [car ownership and ant-car policies of the political leaders](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-19/how-paris-shifted-away-from-the-car).
