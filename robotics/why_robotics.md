# 		Why Robotics research is hard and why you should do it?

###### 				   															Robotics will define this century and you should get on board.



I recently came across this tweet and have been thinking about the value of robotics research and where it is heading. This blog is helpful for someone who is in a similar position as me just starting to get into robotics research and publishing their first paper.

### LLMs are getting good!

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been all over my Twitter feed for the last 3 months and I cannot deny it, they represent some of the greatest shifts in how we use technology. I one for myself have saved hours by avoiding reading through unbearingly annoying documentations to get my plots right. Although, current LLMs might have be limited in their ability to code complex classes meant to last for years managing the world’s banking systems, but it has greatly reduced the barrier to build something by leveling up the playing field atleast between beginners and mid-level coders.  And I appreciate them for this, as I believe that coding skills should not be barrier for someone to build something, the only limit should be our creativity. 

 With all the flashy announcement of a new breakthrough LLMs and million dollar startup ideas every week, it is difficult to see things clearly in short term. The pace at which new developments as well as the iterations of existing technology are happening is unprescedendant. I have been bookmarking tons of new papers every week, but haven’t gotten time to read even one of them. It feels like a catch-up game for me, rather than focusing on building some original research. 

### Is Robotics Research getting hard?

> Manipulation of atoms is way harder than manipulation of bits.

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/), the company behind the ChatGPT started off focusing mainly on Robotics and Reinforcement Learning, but unfortunately it [disbanded it robotics team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=429QC4Yl-mA&t=1153s) in 2021, highlighting the difficulty of lack of data in this field. And they do have a point, robotic hardware is too rigid, too expensive and too slow to collect large amounts of data. That doesn’t mean it is just a hardware problem, the software is to take the blame as much as hardware. People on both the sides seems to blame each other for the failure to achieve capabilities of a general robot able to perform everyday tasks that a human can do.
